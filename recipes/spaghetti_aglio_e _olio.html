      >This is the ultimate minimalist pasta dish, celebrated for its simplicity
      and bold flavors. The spaghetti is tossed in a fragrant sauce of
      garlic-infused olive oil, with just the right kick from red chili flakes.
      It’s light yet flavorful, with the garlic and chili providing a subtle
      heat and aroma. The texture is silky, thanks to the olive oil, and the
      spaghetti glistens in the golden sauce. Garnished with fresh parsley and a
      sprinkle of Parmesan (if desired), it’s a perfect dish when you want
      something quick, elegant, and delicious.</em
